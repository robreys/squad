<h3>FAQ</h3>
<ol>
<li>
 What are tags? Isn't a tag and SQUAD description the same thing?
 	While tags and the SQUAD description may be similar, tags will be
 	used to filter results for other users who wish to join a SQUAD with
 	certain tags. You obviously don't want your 'avaliable SQUAD list' to
 	have League of Legends SQUADs when you want to join a basketball SQUAD.
</li>
<li>
Uhh, I created a SQUAD now what? 
   You can always recruit anyone you want if you have any friends who
   use the app! Have no friends? No problem, be patient and other users
   might want to join your SQUAD!
</li>
<li>I want to tell my SQUAD something, how do I do that?
   SQUAD message feed feature coming soon.
